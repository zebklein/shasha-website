                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-family: corben,serif;">I'm a Michigan licensed psychologist with a part-time private practice in northeast Ann Arbor.  I received a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology  from Michigan State University (1995)  and a Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Professional Psychology, Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan (1998).  My office is located in a professional building with ample parking. It has a private waiting room with a privacy screen for an extra layer of anonymity. Confidential video sessions are available.

        <div class="grid-container">

                <p>Greater reliance and intimacy with God in a direct relationship.</p>
            </div>
        
            <!-- Row 3 (with more text and smaller font) -->
            <div class="grid-item third-row">
                <p>Through the painful process of grief over current or past losses and all the many ways others inevitably fail us, patients in psychodynamic therapy journey towards more freedom and acceptance of reality. As they face and mourn damaged relationships, broken dreams, and endure longings for the impossible, God grows deeper roots of faith and trust for those who want God. Seeing accurately that nothing in the passing  world can ever bring them perfect love and happiness, they seek deeper relationship with God. The fruit of this work is humility and being more authentic in relationships.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="grid-item third-row">
                <p>The work of psychodynamic therapy can be used as a springboard for a lifetime of maturity because it engages the whole person in a process of thoughtful introspection, not just focus on symptom relief.  The ultimate goal is growing towards God, in seeing and trusting in His providential love for us. Through greater emotional healing and psychological maturity, we become more freed of our twisted  projections of God, which we  previously had no choice but to do in our contracted, defensive recoil from the many humiliations, abuse, and losses which is our lot in this 'valley of tears.' </p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="grid-item third-row">
                <p>St Theresa of Jesus  and many of the mystical Doctors of the Church said that <b>prayer</b> (any earnest turning of one's attention to seeking God) and <b>humility</b> are the two most important ingredients to union with God. Because God is our Maker, He's the only One Who can fix us. So turning to Him first, often and sincerely, is our only hope for healing of our brokenness and remedy for our misery. The great, inestimable gift of Christianity is the promise that all are welcome to an intimate friendship with God, which begins in these mortal bodies but continues into eternal life. Through prayer and humility God can turn every cross into a resurrection.</p>
